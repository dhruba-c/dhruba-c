# hi! i am dhrubajyoti

I am a PhD student at Ashoka University, specializing in Economics.

My interest in education in general goes beyond the scope of research; I am deeply engaged in exploring teaching pedagogies and connecting research to teaching. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am involved in various other activities, one of which is writing. I maintain a blog where I share my reflections and insights as I navigate different aspects of life.

This website was created to offer a more comprehensive understanding of who I am beyond my CV. In doing so, I aim to contribute to a discourse that values authenticity and creativity, with the hope that my experiences might resonate with others.

I welcome any questions, comments, or thoughts you may have. Feel free to reach out.

Feel free to explore my research, blogs, and get in touch!
