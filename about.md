# About Me

I am a PhD student at Ashoka University with a focus on Behavioural Economics, Applied Game Theory, and Economics of Institutions. My research explores conflict resolution and group dynamics, incentives behind formation of groups.
I have a keen interest in understanding uncertainty and behavioural models of choice.
